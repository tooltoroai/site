## Example Output

**3-Step Productivity System:**

1. **Define One Clear Outcome** ‚Äî Write down exactly what ‚Äúdone‚Äù means before you start.  
2. **Block Time** ‚Äî Set a 25‚Äì30 minute timer and work only on that task.  
3. **Micro-Reward** ‚Äî When the timer ends, reward yourself with a 5-min break.  

This helps reduce overwhelm and keeps you moving.

## Why It Works

Most people get stuck because they try to multitask or don‚Äôt define ‚Äúdone.‚Äù  
This prompt forces AI to simplify and give you a repeatable framework.  
Over time, it becomes a **mini habit**: define, focus, reward.
